Welcome Sara Oliver,

We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started.

pip install -r requirements.txt

and to update to latest 

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

## Gitpod Reminders
To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

python3 -m http.server

A blue button should appear to click: Make Public,

Another blue button should appear to click: Open Browser.

To run a backend Python file, type python3 app.py, if your Python file is named app.py of course.

A blue button should appear to click: Make Public,

Another blue button should appear to click: Open Browser.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the sudo (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

Log in to your Heroku account and go to Account Settings in the menu under your avatar.
Scroll down to the API Key and click Reveal
Copy the key
In Gitpod, from the terminal, run heroku_config
Paste in your API key when asked
You can now use the heroku CLI program - try running heroku apps to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with Regenerate API Key.

Updates Since The Instructional Video
We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

May 10 2021: Added heroku_config script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

April 7 2021: Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

October 21 2020: Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

October 08 2020: Additional large Gitpod files (core.mongo* and core.python*) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the .gitignore by default.

September 22 2020: Gitpod occasionally creates large core.Microsoft files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A .gitignore file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

April 16 2020: The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

April 13 2020: Added the Prettier code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

February 2020: The initialisation files now do not auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

December 2019: Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type !bscdn in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the README.md file at the official repo for more options.

Happy coding!
